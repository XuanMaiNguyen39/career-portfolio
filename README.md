# DATA SCIENCE CAREER PROGRESSION STUDY PLAN
# The Complete Data Journey: From Analysis to AI (2025-2027)

## You're Absolutely Right - The Proper Data Hierarchy

```
The Natural Progression (Following How Data Actually Flows):

1. Data Analysis → Understand what data means
2. Data Engineering → Build systems to handle data
3. ETL Pipelines → Move and transform data at scale  
4. Data Science → Extract advanced insights
5. ML/AI → Automate and predict (only when pipeline is solid)

Mathematics → Woven throughout as needed (not abstract)
```

**Why This Order:** You can't do ML on bad data. You can't build ETL without understanding data. You can't engineer without knowing what matters.
